// Onset detection: half-wave-rectified spectral flux gated by a robust adaptive
// threshold (rolling median + MAD) and a refractory period.
//
// Lives in utils, not src/audio: it is a stateful event detector, not a
// per-frame scalar feature, so it must stay out of the AudioFeatures barrel.
// Deliberately pure and dependency-free — no browser APIs, caller supplies the
// clock — so the same algorithm can run in workers, on the main thread, or on
// microcontrollers: spectrum bytes in, events out.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// BANDS ARE BINS, NOT Hz
//
// `lowBin`/`highBin` are FFT bin indices. There is no `sampleRate` or `fftSize`
// parameter and no Hz conversion — the caller owns it. Bin spacing for a
// spectrum of N bins produced from an FFT of size 2N is `sampleRate / (2 * N)`.
// Note that this repo's own bass/mids/treble use `sampleRate / fft.length`,
// which is off by 2× and is NOT a correct conversion for this detector.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASURED LIMITATIONS
//
// These are real and characterized. Numbers come from synthetic ground truth
// (44.1 kHz, fftSize 2048, 1024 bins, 60 fps) — see scripts/test/onset-*.mjs.
// Full-band accuracy is excellent: P=1.000 R=1.000 on 90/120/128 BPM kick
// grids, timing error under one frame, and it never fires early.
//
// 1. NARROW BANDS FALSE-FIRE ON UNSMOOTHED FRAMES. On stationary noise, false
//    onsets over 20s by band width: 8 bins → 42, 16 → 39, 32 → 22, 64 → 3,
//    256 → 0, 1024 → 0. A kick band (25–180 Hz) is ~8 bins, which drops a kick
//    band detector to P=0.633 R=0.864. It is scale-invariant, so it is not a
//    tuning problem. Feeding frames from an AnalyserNode with its default
//    `smoothingTimeConstant: 0.8` restores P=1.000 R=1.000 at every band width.
//    If you set `smoothingTimeConstant = 0`, prefer wide bands.
//
// 2. SUSTAINED MODULATION FIRES ONCE PER CYCLE. A 4 Hz broadband tremolo with
//    no transients at all yields 40 onsets in 10s. There is no local-maximum
//    peak-picking stage — the standard third stage of an onset detector — so
//    the first frame crossing the threshold fires. `sensitivity` does not help
//    (3 and 6 both give 40). Relevant to sidechained/pumping material.
//
// 3. ON A PERFECTLY STEADY SPECTRUM, `sensitivity` IS BYPASSED. With mid=0 and
//    mad=0 the threshold falls back to `fluxFloor`, so a +1 LSB uniform rise
//    (0.2% of full scale) fires an onset. The 1e-3 MAD guard is far too small
//    to keep the sensitivity term meaningful there.
