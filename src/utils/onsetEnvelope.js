// Synthesized attack-decay envelope driven by discrete onset events.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// A single audio signal cannot be both a MEASUREMENT and an ANIMATION DRIVER.
// A measurement wants fidelity and immediacy; an animation driver wants
// continuity. Asking one smoothed feature to do both is what produces the
// classic tradeoff: raw features jitter, so you smooth them, and smoothing hard
// enough to stop the jitter also puts the visuals a beat behind the music.
//
// Splitting the two dissolves the tradeoff. The detector measures — it stays
// fast and is allowed to be noisy, because its output is a discrete event, and
// an event is either there or it isn't. This generator animates — it plays back
// a DESIGNED curve. The envelope cannot shudder no matter how noisy the audio
// is, because after the trigger fires there is no audio left in its path: the
// value is a pure function of time-since-trigger and one latched peak.
//
// That is the whole trick, and it is the same one a drum machine uses. You do
// not smooth a kick drum's waveform to get a nice-looking VU response; you
// detect the hit and play an envelope.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FRAME-RATE INDEPENDENCE
//
// The value is computed from an ABSOLUTE timestamp, not accumulated per frame.
// A per-frame recurrence (`v *= 0.9` each frame) silently changes its decay
// time whenever the frame rate changes — the same code decays twice as fast on
// a 120Hz display, and stutters visibly when frames drop. Evaluating a closed
// form at `nowMs` means a dropped frame produces a correctly-placed value
// rather than a delayed one, and the curve is identical at 30, 60 or 144 fps.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// STATE
//
// Three floats and a timestamp, no allocation, no history buffer. Deliberately
// portable to a microcontroller: the only transcendental is a single exp() on
// the decay, which a fixed-point port can replace with a small lookup table or
// swap for `curve: 'linear'`, which needs no transcendental at all.

    curve: 'exp', // 'exp' = percussive, natural. 'linear' = ramp down, no transcendental — for fixed-point ports
    floor: 0, // resting value between events; raise it to keep a visual from going fully dark
    retrigger: 'peak', // 'peak' keeps the louder of the current value and the new hit; 'reset' always jumps to the new hit
